# Python-Calculator-Program

Simple calculator I made in Python.

This program enables a user to select one of four valid operators to perform calculations with two numbers (allows integers and floats). The user cannot add more than two separate numbers to calculate together. 
After each calculation, the user is returned to the main loop of the program to enter another valid operator or enter the letter 'q' to exit the program.

Operators used: + , - , * , /

There are conditions placed on a user such as forcing the user to enter a valid operator and entering an integer or float (not a string) as the first or second number. 
Of course, there are also conditions placed on the calculator such as the various different operator outcomes as well as answering each calculation with 3 decimal points/places.
